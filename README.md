# **Crop Recommendation System ðŸŒ¾**

This project is a machine learning-based system that helps farmers determine the most suitable crop to grow based on various environmental conditions. It uses a dataset containing soil and climate parameters to make predictions, ensuring optimized agricultural output and sustainability.

---

## **Features**
- Predicts the best crop to grow based on input parameters such as:
  - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium levels in the soil
  - Temperature and Humidity
  - Rainfall
- User-friendly web interface for farmers and users.
- Provides a clear and actionable recommendation.
- Fully responsive UI with attractive design.

---

## **Technologies Used**
### **Frontend**
- HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap
- Templates: Jinja2 (for Flask integration)

### **Backend**
- Python (Flask Framework)
- Machine Learning:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### **Database**
- **Dataset**: Crop Recommendation Dataset (`crop_recommendation.csv`)
